		README for mpi_tbb_matrix_vector_multiply.cpp

		=============================================

      This program makes use of both SMP (shared-memory-processor)  (i.e., processors with
      multiple cores) and Message Passing programming ( i.e., distributed systems such as 
      clusters with multiple cores linked by MPI).

      This provides parallelism at all levels for Distributed systems such as clusters with
      nodes having SMP processors.

      In this program the MPI part takes the input (Matrix + Vector) by one process 
      (with rank = 0). Packs this matrix to 1D matrix of equal sizes and distributes to all
      available processes.The vector is 'broadcasted' as such to all the processes.
      Each process than makes use intelTBB to parallely execute vector-matrix multiplication
      process for the chunk it has received. The MPI gather is then used to obtain all small
      chunks of result and integrated to obtain final result.

      Input: Matrix.input and Vector.input file
	     format of above file:
	     <Number of Rows> <Number of Columns in Matrix(none for vector)>
	     <the matrix as is represented on a paper>
	     
      eg:
      Matrix.input:
	     2 2
	     1 0
             0 1 
      Vector.input:
	     2
	     1
	     2

      Output: Final resultant matrix.

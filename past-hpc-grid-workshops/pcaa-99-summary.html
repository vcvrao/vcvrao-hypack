<P><FONT SIZE=3><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">As part of the
newly approved third mission on next generation high performance computing
and communication technology and applications, Centre for Development of
Advanced Computing, C-DAC, conducted a workshop on&nbsp;</FONT> <FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica">PARALLEL
COMPUTING : ALGORITHMS AND APPLICATIONS, (PCAA-99) at National PARAM Supercomputing
Facility (NPSF), C-DAC, Pune, during June 21-25, 1999. The main objectives
of this workshop were to promote parallel computing, to solve large-scale
problems in science and engineering and commercial computing and it also 
provided an opportunity for interactions among the participants from
different academic institutions and research organisations in the country. Also,
the workshop gives an opportunity for starting many more activities
for solving problems in critical areas using parallel processing.&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>The workshop proceedings
covered concepts of current trends in architectural features, network-based
cluster platforms, system software for parallel computers, usage of parallel
computing to scientific and engineering applications. The technical programme
featured one keynote address, fifteen invited lectures, twelve class-room
lectures, two parallel sessions on presentation and demonstration of parallel
scientific applications and three hour hands-on session every day on PARAM
10000. The class-room lectures focused on models of parallel computers,
principles of algorithms design, numerical and non-numerical algorithms.
Hands-on sessions gave an opportunity to write MPI-programs on various
numerical and non-numerical algorithms on PARAM 10000. Hands-on session
was conducted at NPSF, C-DAC where PARAM 10000 was made available to the
participants.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>More than sixty
scientists  attended the workshop from various research institutions,
leading academic institutions such as IIT's and IISc, and universities.
Distinguished speakers from various institutes delivered lectures on high
performance scientific applications. The workshop was well appreciated since it 
gave an organised exposure on parallel computing and writing  MPI based 
parallel programmes for numerical and non-numerical
algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>The workshop started
on June 21 with a keynote address by Dr. V. Rajaraman of the Jawaharlal
Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research of the Indian Institute of
Science, Bangalore, India. In his address Dr. Rajaraman gave an overview
of the state-of-the-art of parallel computing. He said that parallel processing
is going to be an integral part of the computing in all fields of applications
as a lot of parallelism is being planned and built into the processors
of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. R. K. Arora,
Executive Director of C-DAC said that this workshop has come at an opportunate
time as C-DAC has just started on its third mission. During this mission,
C-DAC has proposed a number of projects to further achieve a leadership
position in a critical technology like parallel processing. He also noted
that interactions in this workshop can bring about a lot of new ideas and
opportunities for the researchers to start meaningful collaborative activities
in this area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="verdana, arial, helvetica"><FONT SIZE=3>According to Dr.
V. C. V. Rao, Workshop Coordinator, there was an overwhelming response
for this workshop and several requests could not be entertained due to
limitations in hands-on session. He pointed out that this clearly shows
the existence of large community of scientists and engineers working in
the area of Parallel Computing in the country.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT>&nbsp;

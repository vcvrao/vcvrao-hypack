Programs
--------

1dbsr.f :  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_BSEND and MPI_RECV. Uses 
			  buffered sends.

1dobsr.f : Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_SEND and MPI_RECV. Uses 
			  "pair" blocking send and recvs.

1dsr.f  :  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_SENDRECV. Uses MPI_SENDRECV 
			  buffered sends.

1dnsr.f :  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_ISEND and MPI_IRECV. Uses 
			  non-blocking send and recv calls.

           Non-blocking exchange.  This is similar to blocking, 
		     except that the MPI_WAITALL is called depending on an 
			  input argument (allowing the communication to overlap 
			  computation). It uses nonblocking send and receive 
			  (MPI_ISEND, MPI_IRECV, and MPI_WAITALL)

1dsbsr.f:  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_SEND and MPI_RECV. Uses 
			  blocking send and recvs to exchange the boundary data.

1dss.f  :  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 1-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 1-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using MPI_SSEND and MPI_RECV. Uses 
			  synchronise send and recv library calls 

2dsr.f  :  Solve the 2-d Poisson problem using 2-d decomposition 
			  and the exchange code in exchng1.f 
           Exchange data with neighbors for a 2-d decomposition 
			  of a 2-d domain,using of a 2-d domain, using MPI_SENDRECV

[1] Directory structure.

README   : Gives quick information regarding Package and how to compile 
           and execute

Makefile : Makefile for make utility to compile source codes.

Make.inc : Configuartion file required for compilation

run.sh	 : Shell script to compile and execute the program for different 
	   data sizes in single stroke and generate the result/log in
	   ./result directory	

src/     : Consists of program source code. 

bin/     : Holds the executable generates after the compilation.  

	
[2] Compilation:

1. Before compilation, prepare configuration file 'Make.inc'  with the help of
   a templete provided.

2. Use the following command to compile .
  
   	 	%make compile_all 

[3] Execution

The executable is placed in the bin subdirectory. 
To run the cpu-gpu-dgemm program do the following
	
1. Change the directory to the bin directory 

	  cd ./bin

2. Use the following command for execution 

	 ./<executable> [arguments]  

   Eg.

        % ./cpu-gpu-dgemm 1024 1024 1024

		
Note : User can use the run.sh script to compile and execute the cpu-gpu-dgemm in 
single stroke for different data size. use the below command to execute the scipt 
		 
		% sh run.sh

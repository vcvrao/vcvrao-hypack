Description   :  This program is designed to demonstrate some strategy to hide bandwith latency
                 and concurrent execution of some execution kernel through one stream, while
                 memory copy of data set is also going one for the purpose of executon through
                 other kernel.
		
		 Basically in this exercise we execute bellow kernel in no-stream and stream 
		 approach and compare the total time required for each mode.
		
		kernle detail : 	
			Kernels : A = A + B
				  A = A(T)
				  A = x * A   
	                [Where A and B is Block Matrix]

Input         : All input is controlled through predefined preprocessor directives included in 
		source code. Bellow is the list of all important preprocessor directive .
	
		 REP_COUNT  -	This directive controls the number of repeatation of executing 
				set of task[ execution kernel] before reporting avarage time 
				for execution.
		 MAT_DIMM   -	Directive to define input matrix dimension.
		
		 NSTREAM    -   Number of stream used in this exercise.
		
		 BLOCK_SIZE -   Define thread block diemsion.

		
Output	      :	This primary version of code with un-optimized kernel shows 3 to 4 percent
                improvement in execution time because of applying ladder execution model 
		approach.  The Output shows the coparision of execution time of executing same
		set of task in both mode[ no-stream and stream ].

		Output :
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
		 Kernels : A = A + B, A = A(T) , A = x * A   
		           [Where A and B is Block Matrix]
		 Matrix Dimension : 4096
		 Number of execution stream  : 3
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
		 Starting Stream execution Block :   +3200ms (overall time=3200ms)
		 End Stream execution Block :   +580ms (overall time=3780ms)

		 Starting Non Stream Execution Block :   +0ms (overall time=3780ms)
		 End Non Stream execution Block :   +630ms (overall time=4410ms)
		---------------------------------------------------------------------


How to Compile :
		Type "make" at command prompt at home directory.
			$ make


How to run     : After compilation one executable "run" will be created at home location.
		The type run at home location to execute the code.
		
			$./run

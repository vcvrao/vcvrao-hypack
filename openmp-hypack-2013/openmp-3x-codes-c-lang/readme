[1] List of Sample programs:
-----------------------------
    
 1)  mem-consistency-openmp3x.c :Simple example program to demonstrates the importance to  maintain the memory consistency while using openMP.

 2)  mem-cond-compile-openmp3x.c: Simple example program to illustrate the use of openmp conditional compilation using  _OPENMP macro.

 3)  icv-threads-openmp3x.c : Simple example program to demonstrate the use of OpenMP Library calls to change the 
default values of the internal control variables.

 4)  parallel-construct-openmp3x.c:Simple example program to demonstrate the use of OpenMP parallel construct for coarse-grain parallelism i.e each thread in the parallel region decide which part of the global vector to work on based on the thread ID.

 5)  loop-collapse-openmp3x.c : Simple example program to demonstrates the use of openmp new feature "collapse" clause.
In this example the iteration space over the loop index i and j is collapsed into the single large iteration space which then executed by the team of threads.

 6)    task-construct-alg-openmp3x.c:Simple example program to demonstrates the use of openmp new feature "task" and "taskwait" construct for the parllelization of recursive algorithum ( Fibnacci series)

 7)  link-list-alg-openmp3x.c : The program perform the link list traversal(irregular parallelism) in parallel using the openmp-3.0 feature task construct and openMP-2.5 approach and measure the time taken in both the approches.

 8)  tree-traverse-alg-openmp3x.c :The example program demonstrate the use of openmp new feature task construct to perform the parallelization of hierarchical algorithum (inorder tree traversal) and compare it with the openmp-2.5 approach using single construct & dispaly the time taken in both approcahes

 9)  loop-construct-matvect-openmp3x.c :The program perform the matrix vector multiplication in parallel using the openmp-3.0 feature collapse clause and nested parallel directive openMP-2.5 approach and display the time taken in both the approches.


[2] Compilation 
----------------
    
    Use makefile for compilation, do the appropriate
    change in "Makefile" file according to your system 
    like set the proper path for compiler etc.OpenMP flag
    then use below command :

                      [betatest@btts01 ] make
    
[3] Execution 
--------------

                      % ./<executable> [option]

                        eg.

                                % ./omp-collapse

             OpenMP-3.0 Example Codes Beta-v1.0	
	
File          : mem-consistency-openmp3x.c 

Description   : Simple example program to demonstrates the importance to 
		maintain the memory consistency.

 		In the example program , at Print 1, the value of x could be 
		either 2 or 5,depending on the timing of the threads, and the 
		implementation of the assignment to x. There are two reasons 
      		that the value at Print 1 might not be 5. First,Print 1 might 
		be executed before the assignment to x is executed. Second, even 
		if Print 1 is executed after the assignment,the value 5 is not 
		guaranteed to be seen by thread 1 because a flush may not have 
		been executed by thread 0 since the assignment.

		The barrier after Print 1 contains implicit flushes on all 
		thread as well as a thread synchronization, so the programmer
 		is guaranteed that the value 5 will be printed by both Print 2
 		and Print 3.

Input         : None 

Output        : Value of the variable x

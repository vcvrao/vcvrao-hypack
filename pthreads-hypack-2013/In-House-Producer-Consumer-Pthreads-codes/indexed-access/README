		README for pthread_prod_cons_conditionVariable.cpp and pthread_prod_cons_large.cpp
		==================================================================================

	Both programs implements a producer-consumer program with user defined number of producer-consumer threads and
	user defined size of an array that is used as the 'task-queue' where all the tasks generated by producer are
	placed and from where the consumer obtains available tasks (or resources) for processing.

	The only difference between program "pthread_prod_cons_conditionVariable.cpp" and "pthread_prod_cons_large.cpp"
	is that the first one make use of POSIX thread condition variables, where as, later makes use of POSIX thread 
	mutex objects for accessing the shared task queue respectively.

	
	Input : Executable  <Number of Threads> <Task queue size> <Thread-affinity mask>
		Thread-affinity mask value determines number of processors to which the threads are binded.

       	If no input is given then , following is considered by defaults:
		Number of Threads    = 64 
		Number of Resources  = 1000
		Thread-affinity-mask = default thread-affinity set by system

Pthread program for simple media streaming player, which consists of 
a thread monitoring a network port for arriving data, a decompressor thread for decompressing packets and generating frames
in a video sequence, and a rendering thread that displays frames at programmed intervals. <BR> <BR> 

These three threads must communicate via shared buffers - an in-buffer between the network and decompressor, and an out-buffer 
between the decompressor and renderer. Implement this simple threaded framework. The network thread calls a dummy function 
listen_to_port to gather data from the network. For the sake of this program, this function generates a random string of bytes 
of desired length. The decompressor thread calls function decompress, which takes in data from the in-buffer and returns 
a frame of predetermined size. <BR> <BR>

For this exercise, generate a frame with random bytes. Finally the render thread picks frames from the out buffer and calls the 
display function. This function takes a frame as an argument, and for this exercise, it does nothing. Implement this threaded 
framework using condition variables. Note that you can easily change the three dummy functions to make a meaningful streaming 
media decompressor. <BR> <BR>

 POSIX threads or Pthreads is a portable threading library, which provides consistent programming interface across 
 multiple operating systems. Pthreads is emerged as a standard threading interface for Linux and Unix
 platforms. A number of vendors provide vendor specific thread APIs. More core Pthreads functions on thread
 creation and destruction, synchronization and other thread features. In shared memory multiprocessor 
 architectures, such as SMPs, threads can be used to implement parallelism. Historically, hardware vendors
 have implemented their own proprietary versions of threads, making  portability a concern for 
 software developers.  <BR> <BR> 

   A Thread is a 'Light Weight Process'. A thread is a stream of instructions that can be  scheduled as an independent unit.
 A thread exists within a process, and uses the process resources. Since threads are very small compared with processes, 
thread creation is relatively cheap in terms of CPU costs. As processes require their own resource bundle, 
and threads share resources, threads are likewise memory frugal. There can be multiple threads within a process. 
Multithreaded programs may have several threads running through different code 
paths "simultaneously". <BR> <BR>

  
The IEEE specifies a standard 1003.1c-1995, POSIX API.
For UNIX systems, a standardized C language threads programming interface has
 been specified by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c standard. Implementations that adhere to this standard are referred to 
as POSIX threads, or Pthreads. The concepts used in this "Pthreads on Multi-Cores" are largely 
independent of the API and can be used for programming with other thread APIs (Windows NT threads, 
Solaris threads, Java threads etc.. ). <BR> <BR>


The Pthread module begins with an introduction to concepts, motivations, and design considerations 
for using Pthreads.
 Each of the three major classes of routines in the Pthreads API such as <I> Thread Creation, </i> 
 <I> Thread Termination, </i>
Thread Management, Mutex Variables, 
and Condition Variables. Example codes are used throughout to demonstrate how to use most of the Pthreads routines 
needed by a new Pthreads programmer.  </span> </p>

The most significant recent trend in mass-market processor sales has been the growth of multi-core
 processors. Concurrent programming solutions are required to take advantage of this parallel 
processing capability.  Historically, hardware vendors have implemented their own proprietary 
versions of threads. These implementations differed substantially from 
each other making it difficult for programmers to develop portable threaded applications. <BR> <BR>

Several business motives drive the development of dual-core architectures. 

Additionally, for general-purpose processors, much of the motivation for multi-core processors 
comes from the increasing difficulty of improving processor performance by
 increasing the operating frequency (frequency-scaling). In order to continue 
delivering regular performance improvements for general-purpose processors,
 manufacturers such as Intel and AMD have turned to multi-core designs, sacrificing 
lower manufacturing costs for higher performance in some applications and systems.
Multi-core architectures are being developed, but so are the alternatives. 
An especially strong contender for established markets is to integrate more 
peripheral functions into the chip. <BR> <BR>

Software benefits from multicore architectures where code can be executed in parallel. 
Under most common operating systems this requires code to execute in separate threads or
 processes. Each application running on a system runs in its own process 
so multiple applications will benefit from multicore architectures. Each application may 
also have multiple threads but, in most cases, it must be specifically written to utilize
 multiple threads. Operating system software also tends to run many threads as a part of 
its normal operation. Running virtual machines will benefit from adoption of multiple core 
architectures since each virtual machine runs independently of others and can be executed 
in parallel.

Most application software is not written to use multiple concurrent threads intensively 
because of the challenge of doing so. A frequent pattern in multithreaded application design 
is where a single thread does the intensive work while other threads do much less.
<BR> <BR> 

     In order to take full advantage of the capabilities provided by threads, a standardized programming interface was required. For UNIX systems, this
 interface has been specified by the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c standard (1995). 
Implementations,which adhere to this standard are referred to as POSIX threads, or Pthreads. Most hardware vendors now offer Pthreads in addition to 
their proprietary API's.<BR> <BR>

     Pthreads are defined as a set of C language programming types and procedure calls, implemented with a pthread.h header/include file and a 
thread library - though the this library may be part of another library, such as libc. <BR> <BR>

    The character P in Pthreads stands for POSIX.It is a set of threading interfaces developed by IEEE Committe in charge of specifying a portable 
operating system interface(POSIX). POSIX committee defined a basic set of functions and data structures that it hoped would have been used by 
numerous vendors so that threaded code can be ported easily across operating systems. It specifies API to handle most of actions required by 
threads.It is a library that has  standardized functions for using threads across different platforms.<br> <BR>


In general though, in order for a program to take advantage of Pthreads, it must be able to be organized into discrete, 
independent tasks which can execute concurrently. For example, if routine1 and routine2 can be interchanged, interleaved and/or overlapped in real time, 
they are candidates for threading as shown in Figure 1.

Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) designs have been long implemented using discrete CPUs, 
the issues regarding implementing the architecture and supporting it in software are well known. 
In addition to operating system (OS) support, adjustments to existing software are required to 
maximize utilization of the computing resources provided by multi-core processors.
 Also, the ability of multi-core processors to increase application performance depends 
on the use of multiple threads within applications. <BR> <BR>
The most important challenge in shared-address-space programming is the decomposition of a single 
application into several, dependent and interacting tasks. The efficiency of the parallel program
 is highly dependent on this decomposition step: it determines the synchronization and 
communication overhead. 

Other challenges are synchronization and communication between parallel threads. 
Synchronizing parallel threads is a tedious task: synchronizing too often leads to 
inefficient program execution but not enough synchronization can lead to incorrect results 
due to the data races or condition hazards. Faulty synchronization can lead to deadlocks in
the Shared-address-spcae programming. <BR> <BR>


The shared memory model is quite suitable to Pthread Programming and the users should 
understand concepts of 
synchronization, critical section and deadlock conditions. 
Synchronization 
is an enforcing mechanism used to impose constraints on the order of execution of threads.
 The features of the Shared 
memory model : </span> </p>

The  communication is implicit in shared-address-space programming and much of the effort 
associated with writing correct threaded programs is difficult. The correctness of the 
programs is spent on synchronizing concurrent  threads and respect to their data accesses
or scheduling.  The synchronization primitives in Pthreads are mutual exclusion for shared
variables, overheads of Locking, condition variables for Synchronization, controlling Thread
and synchronization attributes,  attribute objects for mutexes, thread cancellation,  
composite synchronization constructs and Barrier construct. The basic library calls used are listed below.

compile and execute benchmark:  <BR> <BR>

First,  you need to go in the  directory named <i> In-House-Pthreads-Benchmarks  </i> </span> </p> 

<br>

Then you need to give : <br> <br>

<font color ="red">
<i>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make &lt;benchmark-name&gt; THREADS=&lt;Number of threads&gt; CLASS=&lt;Class-Name&gt;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color ="red">
&lt;benchmark-name&gt; </font> is name of benchmark which you want to run,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color ="red">

&lt;Number of threads&gt;  </font> is Number of threads whether 1 / 2 / 4 / 8<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color ="red">

&lt;Class-Name&gt; </font> is Class Name i. e.  A, B or C which is different problem sizes<br><br><br>



Ex: If you want to run PI benchmark then,<br><br>
       <font color ="red">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make pi THREADS=2 CLASS=A <br><br></i> </font>

This statement will compile our benchmark PI.
After this you need to go in bin directory i.e.<br><br>

<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$ cd bin <br><br></i>

In bin, an executable  will be created in the form<br><br>
<font color ="red">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;benchmark-name&gt;.&lt;Number of Threads&gt; . &lt;Class-Name&gt;<br><br></i> </font>

              Too many threads can seriously degrade program performance. <br>The impact comes in two ways. First partitioning a
 fixed amount of work among  too many threads and this may give too little work for each thread. This leads to overhead of 
 starting and terminating threads swamps the useful work. Second, having too many concurrent software threads incurs overheads
 from having to share fixed hardware resources.

   Spawning  application software threads than hardware threads, the OS typically resorts to
   round robin scheduling.  The scheduler gives each software a short turn, called a time  slice to run on one
   of the hardware threads. Too many  software threads, thread's time slice, run the hardware thread may incur overhead, 
   resulting performance degradation.

With emergence of cache on each core,  the access time from cache memory is 10
 to 100 times faster than main memory and the data access that hit

 in cache are fast. They do not consume bandwidth of the memory bus.  
This may lead to conflict of data sharing and the net effect is too many threads hurt 
performance while they share the data in cache. Thus the time slicing causes 
threads to fight each other for real memory and thus hurts the performance.

 <li>
    <P align = "justify"> <span class="content">  

A similar overhead at a different level, is thrashing virtual memory.
 Most systems use virtual memory, where the processors have 
an address space bigger than the actual available  memory. 
Virtual memory resides on disk and the frequently used portions 
are kept in real memory. For a large problem size, too many threads lead to exceed even virtual memory.

    <P align = "justify"> <span class="content">  

Thread lock implementation is another issue in which all
the threads may wait to acquire a lock and it is closely related
 to thread time slicing. In some situations,  all the threads
 waiting for the lock must now wait for the holding thread 
to wake-up and release the lock.  This leads to an additional overhead as the threads wait behind (blocking effect).

Runnable threads, not blocked threads, cause time-slicing,
 overhead. When a thread is blocked waiting for an external event,
 such as disk I/O request, the  OS takes it off the round-robin 
schedule. Here, a blocked thread does not cause time-slicing overhead 
and a program may have more software threads than hardware threads, and 
still run efficiently if most of the OS threads are blocked. 
 The concept of compute threads & I/O threads may help to reduce the overheads.
 Special care is needed to ensure that the compute threads should match the <br>processor resources.

Unsynchronized access to shared memory  can introduce race

Deadlocks, and Live Locks. Race condition are typically

 associated with locks, it can  happen any time a thread

The other issues such as memory contention and conserver
 band-width and working in the cache. The memory contention on
mutli-core processors is difficult to understand. The applications 
which require to work within cache becomes complex because the data
 is not only transferred between  a core and memory, but also between 
cores. The transfer of data aris implicitly from patterns of reads and 
write by different cores.  The patterns correspond to two types
 of data-dependencies (Read-write dependency; Write-write dependency).

The performance of program depends on processors fetching 
most of their data from cache instead of main memory.  When two 
threads increments a different location belonging to the same cache
 line, the cores must pass the sector back and forth across the memory bus. 
 The performance merely depends upon the locations whether they are adjacent or
 not on the same cache line.  Aligning  false sharing is required and it
 can be done by aligning variables or objects in memory on cache line boundaries.

<b><font color="Black" size = "2" >What is Thread? </font></b> 

<P align = justify> <span class="content" >

	A thread is a stream of instructions that can be scheduled as an independent unit. A thread 
exists within a process, and uses the process resources. Since threads are very 
small compared with processes, thread creation is relatively cheap in terms of CPU costs. 


<br> <br>
	A Thread is an encapsulation of the flow of control in a program. Most people are used to
 writing single-threaded programs - that is,programs that only execute one path through their code "at a time". 
Multithreaded programs may 
have several threads running through different code paths "simultaneously". </span> </p>



 <font color="Black" size = "2"> <b> Why are threads interesting ? </b> </font> <br><br>       

<P align = justify> <span class="content" >

	A context switch between two threads in a single process is considerably cheaper than a context 
switch between two processes. In addition, the fact that all data except for stack 
and registers are shared between threads makes them a natural vehicle for expressing tasks 
that can be broken down into subtasks that can be run cooperatively.

</span> </p>


 <font color="Black" size = "2" >  <b> What are Pthreads ? </b> </font> <br><br>

 <P align = justify> <span class="content" >

  Pthreads stands from POSIX Threads. POSIX threads, based on the IEEE POSIX 1003.1c-1995
  (also known as the ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996) standard, part of the ANSI/IEEE 1003.1, 1996 edition,
  standard.The Pthreads library is a POSIX C API thread library that has standardized 
  functions for using threads across different platforms. It is a set of threading interfaces
  developed by IEEE Committee in charge of specifying a portable operating system interface(POSIX).
  POSIX committee defined a basic set of functions and data structures that it hoped would have
  been used by numerous vendors so that threaded code can be ported easily across operating 
  systems.It specifies API to handle most of actions required by threads.It is a library that has
  standardized functions for using threads across different platforms.

 <b><font color="Black" size = "2" > What is Lightweight process ? </font></b> <br><br>

 <P align = justify> <span class="content" >
        A lightweight process (also known in some implementations, confusingly, as a kernel thread) is 
a schedulable entity that the kernel is aware of. On most systems, it consists 	of some execution 
context and some accounting information (i.e. much less than a 	full-blown process).<br>
        Several operating systems allow lightweight processes to be "bound" to particular CPUs; this guarantees
 that those threads will only execute on the specified CPUs.
 <span. </span> </p> 

 <b><font color="Black" size = "2" > What does MT safety mean? </font></b> <br><br>

 <P align = justify> <span class="content" >

      	If some piece of code is described as MT-safe, this indicates that it can be used safely within a
 multithreaded program, and that it supports a "reasonable" level of concurrency. This isn't very interesting;
 what you, as a programmer using threads, need to worry about 	is code that is not MT-safe. MT-unsafe code may use
 global and/or static data. If you need to call MT-unsafe code from within a multithreaded program, you
 may need to go to some effort to ensure that only one thread calls that code at any time.
        Wrapping a global lock around MT-unsafe code will generally let you call it from within a multithreaded 
program, but since this does not permit concurrent access to that code, it is not considered to make 
it MT-safe.
</span> </p>

 <font color="Black" size = "2" > <B> What is thread Scheduling? </b> </font> <br><br>

 <P align = justify> <span class="content" >
 
   Scheduling involves deciding what thread should execute next on a particular CPU. It is usually also 
   taken as involving the context switch to that thread. 
 </span> </p> 



 <font color="Black" size = "2" > <B> What are the different kinds of threads? </b> </font> <br><br>

 <P align = justify> <span class="content" >
            There are two main kinds of threads implementations:<br><br>

   <li>  User-space threads  </li><br>
   <li> Kernel-supported threads. </li> <br> <br>


      There are several sets of differences between these different threads implementations.
  </span> </p>



<font color="Black" size = "2" > <b> Architectural differences: </b>  </font> <br><br>
     
<P align = justify> <span class="content" >
   User-space threads live without any support from the kernel; they maintain all of their state in user space. 
Since the kernel does not know about them, 
they cannot be scheduled to run on multiple processors in parallel.
<br> <br>

                Kernel-supported threads fall into two classes.
 In a "pure" kernel-supported system, the kernel is responsible for scheduling all threads. Systems 
in which the kernel cooperates with a user-level library to do scheduling are known as two-level, 
or hybrid, systems. Typically, the kernel schedules LWPs, and the user-level library schedules threads onto LWPs. 
Because of its performance problems (caused by the need to cross the user/kernel protection boundary twice 
for every thread context switch), the former class has fewer members than does the latter (at least on Unix variants).
 Both classes allow threads to be run across multiple processors in parallel.

</span> </p> 
  

<font color="Black" size = "2" > <b>Performance differences: </b> </font> <br><br>


<P align = justify> <span class="content" >
                In terms of context switch time, user-space threads are the fastest, with two-level 
threads coming next (all other things being equal). However, if you have a multiprocessor, user-level 
threads can only be run on a single CPU, while both two-level and pure kernel-supported threads can be 
run on multiple CPUs simultaneously.<br><br>
</span> </p>

<font color="Black" size = "2" > <B> Potential problems with functionality: </b> </font> <br><br>

<P align = justify> <span class="content" >
                Because the kernel does not know about user threads, there is a danger that ordinary 
blocking system calls will block the entire process (this is bad) rather than just the calling thread. 
This means that user-space threads libraries need to jump through hoops in order to provide "blocking" 
system calls that don't block the entire process. This problem also exists with two-level 
kernel-supported threads, though it is not as acute as for user-level threads. What usually 
happens here is that system calls block entire LWPs. This means that if more threads exist 
than do LWPs and all of the LWPs are blocked in system calls, then other threads that could 
potentially make forward progress are prevented from doing so.<br> <BR>

                The Solaris threads library provides a reasonable solution to this problem. 
If the kernel notices that all LWPs in a process are blocked, it sends a signal to the process. 
This signal is caught by the user-level threads library, which can create another LWP so that 
the process will continue to make progress.
